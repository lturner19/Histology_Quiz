# CODE QUIZ

## Introduction

As a student who is just beginning their coding experience by taking a web development bootcamp, I wanted to build a timed quiz that could test my knowledge in my current career. 
As a registered Histology Technician and am required by CLIA to take a yearly competency to assess my knowledge pertaining to the Mohs field. 

## Features
 
 When the "Start Quiz" button is clicked by the user, the quiz is initiated.  A question will appear screen as well the timer.  The user has 90 seconds to finish the 6 questions, however the selection of an incorrect answer results in a 10 second penalty. 

After the completion of the test, the user is shown their score and may enter their initials to have their score stored.  
This enables the user to monitor their progress until they obtain a perfect score.


 ## Credit
To style the container, I used the styling suggested by Web Dev Simplified on youTube episode "Build A Quiz App with Javascript"

To put the timer code together, I used w3schools.com.
